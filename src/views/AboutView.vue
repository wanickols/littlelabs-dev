    <h2 class="titlexl">About Me</h2>

    <h3 class="subtitle mt-6">What I Build — and Why</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I'm a developer, but more importantly, I'm a functional person. I don’t
      just build things for the sake of building — I build to last. I believe
      software should be efficient, understandable, and sustainable. Whether
      it’s a small app or a game with narrative depth, I care that it works —
      today, tomorrow, and even 20 years from now.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle mt-6">My Values</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I value sustainability, privacy, and reducing friction — for both the
      developer and the user. I code efficiently not just for performance, but
      because efficient code is easier to debug, maintain, and reason about.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph mt-2">
      My goal is to create tools and experiences that respect the user’s time,
      attention, and data. If something can do more with less, it should.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle mt-6">Current Projects</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I work on projects under the name <strong>Little Labs</strong>. Right now,
      that includes:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside paragraph">
      <li>
        A minimalist mood tracking app that runs offline and respects your
        privacy
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Observer</em>, a personal narrative game exploring freedom, control,
        and faith
      </li>
      <li>
        This website, a hub for the tools, games, and ideas I want to share
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="subtitle mt-6">A Little More</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I try to live simply and think deeply. I believe tech should serve people,
      not the other way around. If I can make something that helps someone feel
      more grounded, more free, or more understood — that’s worth building.
